Write a resonant bandpass audio plug-in in C++.

This is a simple resonant bandpass filter that can be used to process audio signals. It is implemented as a C++ class with a few member functions. The constructor takes the cutoff frequency and resonance parameters as arguments. The process() member function takes an input signal and applies the filter to it.

The filter is implemented using a simple IIR filter design. The cutoff frequency determines the center frequency of the filter band. The resonance parameter controls the width of the filter band. A higher resonance value results in a narrower band.

The filter code is based on the example in the "Designing IIR Filters" section of the "Digital Signal Processing" chapter of the book "The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing" by Steven W. Smith.
